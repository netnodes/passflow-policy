**Opting out of tracking via your mobile device:** If you are using a mobile device, you can opt out of having your mobile identifier used for certain types of Interest Based Advertising, including those performed by us, by accessing the settings in your Apple or Android mobile device and following the most recent published instructions. If you opt-out, no further data collection or tracking will occur.

**Do Not Track:** Some Internet browsers – like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari – include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals.

NetNodes takes privacy seriously and will continue monitoring developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard. To learn more about “DNT,” please visit “All About Do Not Track.”
