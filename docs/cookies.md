**Browser controls:** The configuration of most internet browsers allows you to manage cookies, including clearing or blocking their use. Please be aware that disabling cookies can impair optimal navigation of our Sites.  As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.

**Disabling most Interest Based Advertising:** Most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit [http://www.aboutads.info/choices/](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) or [http://www.youronlinechoices.com](http://www.youronlinechoices.com).

**Opting out of tracking via your mobile device:** If you are using a mobile device, you can opt out of having your mobile identifier used for certain types of Interest Based Advertising, including those performed by us, by accessing the settings in your Apple or Android mobile device and following the most recent published instructions. If you opt-out, no further data collection or tracking will occur.

**Do Not Track:** Some Internet browsers – like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari – include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, some features of the PassFlow Sites do not respond to browser “DNT” signals. PassFlow takes privacy seriously and will continue monitoring developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard. To learn more about “DNT,” please visit “All About Do Not Track.”
